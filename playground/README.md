# Playground

Playground contains development code for HackFS2024. It is separated into three main directories: `core_contracts`, `galadriel`, and `ipfs`.

## core_contracts
`core_contracts` contains development contracts for the core Decentralized Collaborative Technology Tree.

## ipfs
`ipfs` is used to store research documents in JSON format.

- To learn how to store and retrieve JSON documents, refer to `./nbs/ipfs_json.ipynb`.
- The file `./ipfs/akash-template/deploy.yml` contains code to deploy an IPFS node on the Akash network.

## galadriel
`galadriel` contains contracts to deploy to the Galadriel AI network and includes scripts to interact with the contracts.

### Directory Structure
- `./core_contracts`: Development contracts for the Decentralized Collaborative Technology Tree.
- `./ipfs/nbs/ipfs_json.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating how to store and retrieve JSON documents.
- `./ipfs/akash-template/deploy.yml`: Deployment script for an IPFS node on the Akash network.
- `./galadriel`: Contracts and scripts for deploying and interacting with the Galadriel AI network.
